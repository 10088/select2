    What events will Select2 trigger?

    How can I attach listeners for these events?

  <h3>
    What events does Select2 listen for?
  </h3>

  <p>
    Select2 will listen for the <code>change</code> event on the
    <code>&lt;select&gt;</code> that it is attached to. If you make any
    external changes that need to be reflected in Select2 (such as changing the
    value), you should trigger this event.
  </p>

{% highlight js linenos %}
$('select').val('US'); // Select the option with a value of 'US'
$('select').trigger('change'); // Notify any JS components that the value changed
{% endhighlight %}

  <h3>
    Can I trigger an event other than <code>change</code> to notify Select2 of changes?
  </h3>

  <p>
    It's common for other components to be listening to the <code>change</code>
    event, or for custom event handlers to be attached that may have side
    effects. Select2 does not have a custom event (like
    <code>select2:update</code>) that can be triggered other than
    <code>change</code>. You can rely on jQuery's event namespacing to limit
    the scope to Select2 though by triggering the <code>change.select2</code>
    event.
  </p>

{% highlight js linenos %}
$('select').val('US'); // Change the value or make some change to the internal state
$('select').trigger('change.select2'); // Notify only Select2 of changes
{% endhighlight %}

    What events can be prevented? How can I prevent a selection from being made?
